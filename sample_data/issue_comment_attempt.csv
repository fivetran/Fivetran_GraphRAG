"1337197271","1383635883","Hi All,
I have upgraded to the latest 0.7.4 packages for Stripe (both the source and normal package) and I am still getting very similar errors as the original issue.

```
11:37:30  Database Error in model stg_stripe__plan (models/stg_stripe__plan.sql)
11:37:30    Syntax error: Unexpected keyword AS at [199:2]
11:37:30    compiled Code at target/run/stripe_source/models/stg_stripe__plan.sql
```

When I check out the compiled SQL I can see a field called `interval` listed in the select list:
```
    interval
    
 as plan_interval 
```

This is failing because on BigQuery `interval` is a reserved word and the query parser isn't liking the syntax.

I believe here that, to ensure issues like this do not happen, at least in BigQuery, they should be quoted using the tick so that reserved words can be referenced in a query i.e.:

```
    `interval`
    
 as plan_interval 
```

The above SQL now passes and the model is able to run.

Can this be looked into please?

It is worth noting that I am not using any `vars` or any additional configuration apart from running the model directly.","2022-12-05 11:49:06.000000 UTC","2022-12-05 11:50:28.000000 UTC","80682772","2024-08-07 21:43:48.849000 UTC"

"1337571442","1383635883","Hi @CraigWilson-ZOE thanks for raising this with out team. I think the issue you are detailing is different from the original issue outlined in this Bug Report. This bug report was detailing reserved words within the `metadata` fields that are being parsed out via a `var`. 

Your bug however, is a field that is explicitly being selected within the model (regardless of the var) and could not be addressed using the metadata solution outlined in this bug report. 

I did try to recreate the issue you had using the latest version of the package(s) and saw the `interval` field was being backticked in the compiled code and ran successfully on BigQuery 🤔 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74217849/205674290-84cc9b79-6d15-409d-8bbe-7c8d18f8c411.png)

The quoting should be happening within the [get_plan_columns](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source/blob/f3da087187c97eb48cee6ff591056cc6f1be900e/macros/get_plan_columns.sql#L25-L26) macro from the source package. The only way I could see dbt skipping over the quote is if the `target.type` for your dbt adapter is not BigQuery. Would you be able to confirm that the profiles.yml for your dbt target is a BigQuery type in this instance? 

For a more immediate fix, you may be able to downgrade just your stripe_source package to `v0.7.3` as the only change from `v0.7.4` was some under the hood updates and adjusting this `interval` cast to be performed within the macro opposed to the select statement.","2022-12-05 15:25:17.000000 UTC","2022-12-05 15:25:17.000000 UTC","74217849","2024-08-07 21:43:48.849000 UTC"
"1337663740","1383635883","Ah! I think you have solved the issue for me actually.

We are using the `fal adapter` for our dbt, so that we can run Python models locally and not have to spin up a data proc cluster. This means that our `target.type` won't be BigQuery.

Here is a excerpt from our `profiles.yml`:

```yml
default:
  target: development
  outputs:
    development:
      type: fal
      threads: 16

    warehouse:

I can see how this would cause an error for you with the target.type not matching our supported warehouses target.type names. That being said, you are using BigQuery so I still feel this can be supported. I am just not entirely familiar with the fal target and how it differs from the basic BigQuery target.

Before we talked further about this feature, I did want to bring light to the `metadata` fields that are synced within the Fivetran Stripe connector. This field is a JSON object that contains extra fields and information related to your base tables that weren't awarded their own specific field. This is usually due to the fact that not all customers may have these fields. 

Do you by chance see the `paid_out_of_bond` field within the `metadata` JSON object of your invoice table? If so, you can leverage the feature of this package to [pivot out a metadata field](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe#pivoting-out-metadata-properties) in order to leverage it in your down stream analysis.

Let me know if this was helpful. If you are unable to find that field in the metadata object then we can chat more about the possible implementation of this feature.

Yeah I would be happy to support this within the package but it seems like there would be too many edge cases that we wouldn't be able to account for in our logic if we implemented a transformation to recreate the field. Since it seems to be a similar request from other customers, it may be the most beneficial to add this field into the connector itself. I would rather have the connector produce something 100% accurate than try our best to recreate the field in the dbt package and see it not work in all cases.

I've been running into the error as @shaon-chowdhury. Is there a way using this package that I can remap `subscription` to `subscription_history`?

"1095072678","1184917439","Hi @rhinck you can in fact remap the package to point at the `subscription_history` table instead. To do so you can add the following to your `dbt_project.yml`

```yml
##dbt_project.yml

vars:
   subscription: ""database.schema.subscription_history""
```

Likewise, if you would like to create your own source file that includes the `subscription_history` table then you can leverage the dbt source macro, otherwise the above will work just fine.

Further, this is being discussed in more detail within this [PR](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source/pull/37).

"1245542623","1371444129","Hi @nbenezri my apologies as I misread your initial question. I was under the assumption you were unable to replicate the metadata fields in the staging models.

Currently the package only brings the customer metadata fields through to the final model. The other metadata fields are restricted to the staging models. If you are looking to bring other metadata fields through to the final models we can use this issue as a feature and plan to incorporate them in a future release.

For the time being, if you wanted to bring in the metadata fields prior to our feature update I would recommend either one of the following options:
- Create your own model that references the end model produced by the package and join in the metadata fields from the staging model.
- Disable the package model and recreate it in your own project with you metadata fields included.
   - To disable the model you can use the below config.
   - You will then create a model with the same name (`stripe__invoice_line_items`) in your root dbt project and copy/paste the sql used and edit it to your liking.
```yml
models:
  stripe:
     stripe__invoice_line_items:
        +enabled: false
```

You are correct that since the package contents are stored in the `dbt_packages` folder, you are unable to edit them directly. However, you can use one of the options above to customize them to your liking.

2. how to make variables specific to a certain model?  because I would like to copy `dbt_packages/stripe/dbt_project.yml` I'm my main one so all the SQL I copy will work, and so they won't coliade with other packages/models.
3. how to change the target materialized from a view to a table?
4. how to change the target schema?

"1246877905","1371444129","Hi @nbenezri if you wanted to fork the repo and make your changes directly in your own fork that may be easiest. You can then install your fork (with your custom changes) instead of our package. You would use the following syntax in your `packages.yml` to install your forked version of the package.
```yml
packages:
  - git: https://github.com/nbenezri/dbt_stripe.git

```

This way you can make whatever changes you want directly in your own codebase and it will still be installed as a package. This will allow you to circumvent the need for disabling and copy/pasting which can result in a bunch of headache and compilation errors as dbt has a bunch of rules with disabling and having models with the same name.

I see exactly what you are talking about with postgres support for the macro is not possible at the moment. However, you do call out a good point with how dbt_utils handles this currently for postgres. To adjust this macro to allow for postgres support I believe all we would need to do is open a PR that adds a new `postgres__date_timezone(column)` section within the macro. Similar to how we have it for bigquery:
https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/blob/de061f7ac38f49b029b95e4dffe01becb930ff05/macros/date_timezone.sql#L7-L14

I noticed you mentioned you would be open to creating a PR on your end! We are always excited when people from the community want to contribute back to our packages. Please let me know if you would like to work on a PR to account for postgres compatibility in this macro. I am happy to help answer any questions you may have!

"1109114523","1120843886","I did some additional testing against our production data.

First, I validated data within Stripe alone to check differences between the `subscription_id` between the two tables in question:

```
with invoice_subs as (
  
    select
      invoices.id as invoice_id,
      invoices.date as invoice_created_at,
      invoices.status as invoice_status,
      invoices.subscription_id,
      invoices.total / 100.00 as invoice_total,
      invoice_line_items.source_type,
      invoice_line_items.proration as is_proration,
      invoice_line_items.subscription as invoice_line_item_sub_id,
      invoice_line_items.amount / 100.00 as invoice_line_item_amount,
      case when invoices.subscription_id = invoice_line_items.subscription
        then true
      else false end as sub_matches,
      prices.id as price_id,
      prices.recurring_interval,
      products.id as product_id,
      products.active as is_active

    from invoices

    join invoice_line_items 
      on invoices.id = invoice_line_items.invoice_id
    left join prices
      on invoice_line_items.price_id = prices.id
    left join products
      on prices.product_id = products.id
  
  )
  
  select * from invoice_subs where sub_matches = false
```
  

I exported the data and reviewed several scenarios and pulled up invoices in the UI to confirm my findings. See below:

- Reviewing invoices, invoice line items, subscriptions data in Stripe where the `subscription_id` does not match between the `invoices` and `invoice_line_items`. Total count: 4,600
	- The `invoice_line_items` that do not have a `subscription_id`  and `invoices` does. Total count: 625
		- All but 1 were related to proration and all were `invoiceitem` source type.
		- Spot checking some of these and they have multiple line items that appear related to subscription changes so I would have expected a `subscription_id` on the `invoice_line_items` instead.
		- Only 16 were related to invoices where the `total` was greater than 0.
		- There doesn't appear to be any trends related to timing of the creation of the invoices. Seen as far back as August 2016 and as recent as the April 2022.
		- Conclusion: These invoices were either created in a way that broke the `invoice_line_items` relationship or there is a bug.
	- The `invoice_line_items` that do have a `subscription_id` and `invoices` does not is related to proration where each line item links to the current and previous subscription. Total count: 3888
		- Note: there were 3 that weren't related to proration, but they were `One-time` price/products  - not sure why a `subscription_id` would be recorded for these.
		- Conclusion: Other than the 3, this was an expected difference. I do not believe it is worth investigating further.
	- Both the `invoice_line_items` and `invoices` `subscription_id` are `null`. Total count: 87
		- All but 1 are related to `One-time` price/products. The single exception also showed `subscription` as the source type. Not sure why a `subscription_id` wasn't recorded.
		- Conclusion: Other than the 1, this was an expected result. I do not believe it is worth investigating further.
	- Overall conclusion: There appears to be scenarios where only the `invoices` records a `subscription_id` which is a cause for concern if only relying on the `invoice_line_items` table. It is unclear to me if this problem is created by the implementation and creation of the invoices on our end or is caused by a bug. In either case, it may make sense to fallback to the `invoices.subscription_id` if there is no `invoice_line_items.subscription_id`.

The next step is checking against the data being synced to our data warehouse which when running a similar query gave far more results which leads me to believe there are changes happening on the invoice and/or the line items that isn't syncing or there is a delay. More to come.

Update: When running the same query against the data warehouse:

- There was an additional 4,325 records that do not have a `invoice_line_items.subscription_id`.
	- All of them show as `subscription` type.
	- Only 28 records were prior to 01/01/22 with the oldest being Sept 2019.
	- The `invoice_line_item.id` appears to reflect the `subscription_id` for these records.
	- Conclusion: There appears to be a long delay or bug with syncing, updating the `invoice_line_items` records to reflect the correct IDs. This has significant impact since this value would be used to filter and join subscription data.
- Additional testing: I did the same query using `invoice_items` and that came much closer to the sources differences. 4,577. Though, in both the source and destination it would appear this table has less records than the `invoice_line_items` table and is missing some needed columns.","2022-04-25 22:48:48.000000 UTC","2022-04-25 23:59:28.000000 UTC","24665116","2024-08-07 21:43:48.014000 UTC"

"1258107576","1383635883","Hi @LewisDavies thanks so much for opening this issue. This is a very interesting error you are coming across. I have a few quick questions to better understand the root of the issue:
- Can you confirm for the full stop case `feature.id`, that the field name in the JSON object is indeed listed as `feature.id`. I don't imagine the JSON macro we have that pivots the fields would be causing this, but want to confirm the source is accurate and we just need to account for these edge cases.
- Similar to the above, do you know if Stripe has any guardrails in place for these metadata fields? For example, can fields be created with special characters? If so, we will need to add regex matching into the code logic to account (find and replace) for these special characters.
- Would you be able to share the contents of the `target/run/stripe_source/models/stg_stripe__plan.sql` file? I am curious to see how the compiled sql looks for this model.

In addition to the above questions, I feel the `set` issue may possibly be able to be addressed by double quoting the fields in the variable list. Would you be able to attempt the following:
```yml
vars:
    stripe__plan_metadata: ['""set""','feature.id','etc.']
```

I am not positive it will work, but would be worth the try! I will keep digging in on my end to see if there is a better way to address the reserved word issue. In the meantime, it would be great if you could help provide details to my above questions as well.

"1555128638","1713202702","Hi @pietrotansini I have been able to explore this a bit further and have been able to identify the core issue. It seems new connectors set up against a BigQuery destination are syncing JSON fields as a JSON datatype; however, previous connectors are syncing JSON fields as a STRING datatype. As such, when the package is attempting to union the tables across schemas it is finding conflicting datatypes for the `metadata` field (as some are STRING type and others are JSON type).

Unfortunately there is not much we can do within the dbt package itself. Especially as we are unable to do a JSON to STRING or STRING to JSON cast. My recommendation at the moment would be to open a [support ticket](https://support.fivetran.com/hc/en-us) to discuss the issue you are seeing with our support team as they will be able to help with any next steps in triaging the datatype mismatch you are seeing.","2023-05-19 19:22:08.000000 UTC","2023-05-19 19:22:08.000000 UTC","74217849","2024-08-07 21:43:49.261000 UTC"

- The full stops are in the field names taken from Stripe, so the name appears as `feature.id` in the raw data Fivetran has imported.
- There don't seem to be any guardrails around the field names other than [how many you can add and how long they are](https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata).
- The full file is pretty long but the key part is in the `final` CTE:
```
replace(json_extract_path_text(try_parse_json( metadata ), 'plan.id' ), '""', '') as plan.id,
replace(json_extract_path_text(try_parse_json( metadata ), 'plan.handle' ), '""', '') as plan.handle,
replace(json_extract_path_text(try_parse_json( metadata ), 'set' ), '""', '') as set,

I understand you are wanting to bring the metadata fields through to the end models. However, we did intentionally exclude those from a number of end models in a previous release as we were being mindful of scope creep and were not sure if users wanted these fields to persist to the end models. As such, I will restructure this issue as a feature request to include the metadata columns to the end models.

That being said, I believe you have the right approach for how this should be integrated into the end models in the manual code snippets you shared above. Before accepting this feature I would want to understand a bit more which metadata fields you are most interested in persisting to which downstream models. The main reason we excluded these in the first place was we found extra complexity being added and were unsure of the benefits for including the fields if we made the models more complex. Or would you prefer all metadata fields are persisted downstream to the relevant models no matter what?","2023-06-13 20:00:47.000000 UTC","2023-06-13 20:00:47.000000 UTC","74217849","2024-08-07 21:43:49.261000 UTC"

My personal view is that we should only incorporate the timezone when we are 'date_trunc'-ing to something that _is not_ a timestamp. I feel we should leave timestamps as UTC, and let BI tools (or users) do the final mile there if they prefer. 

Therefore, I have (1) created a new macro that takes timezones into account and (2) replaced column references in that macro wherever we were converting a timestamp to a date, month, quarter, week, etc.

Example config looks like:
```yml
vars:
    stripe_timezone: 'America/New_York'

"1895922607","2085728869","hey there 👋  -- so just to clarify, the below code is something you've added manually to a forked version of the `stripe__invoice_details` model?
```sql
    {% if var('stripe__invoice_metadata',[]) %}
      {% for metadata in var('stripe__invoice_metadata') %}
          ,invoice.{{ metadata }} as invoice_{{ metadata }}
      {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
```

if i'm understanding that correctly, i believe you would need to adjust the above to treat `stripe__invoice_metadata` as a dictionary instead of a list. so something like
```sql
    {% if var('stripe__invoice_metadata',[]) %}
      {% for metadata in var('stripe__invoice_metadata') %}
          ,invoice.{{ metadata.alias if metadata.alias else metadata.name }} as invoice_{{ metadata.alias if metadata.alias else metadata.name }}

We are actually actively working within PR #48 to migrate our package (and all other packages) to support the dbt-utils v1.0.0 version once it is released.

"1310891593","1383635883","Hey @fivetran-reneeli, here are a couple of models that don't pull through the metadata fields. The logic is all there, the columns have just been excluded from the final output.
- [stripe__subscription_details](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_stripe/#!/model/model.stripe.stripe__subscription_details#code) doesn't include the fields added in [stg_stripe__subscription](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_stripe/#!/model/model.stripe_source.stg_stripe__subscription#code). 
- [stripe__invoice_line_items](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_stripe/#!/model/model.stripe.stripe__invoice_line_items) doesn't include fields from [stg_stripe__plan](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_stripe/#!/model/model.stripe_source.stg_stripe__plan#code).

I believe the addition of the `subscription_item_id` to the `stripe__invoice_line_item` table makes sense to me and could be leveraged by others. In addition to your updates already in the PR, would you be able to include this field in the `stripe.yml` documentation for this model?

- So summing up our slack convo, since we're making many updates to our Stripe package this quarter I plan on including the point about bringing down the metadata fields to the final models. Will be addressing the other requests you and other customers have made as well in our overhaul as well 👍 
- As for the json values, we have the fix although it's going to be within our [fivetran utils package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_fivetran_utils/tree/releases/v0.4.latest), not the stripe package itself. The next release of stripe will have these updates, if you want to keep an eye out for that. Keep in mind the next stripe release is also dependent on the release of dbt v1.

"1028489846","1120843886","🤔 I have been looking over some of the SQL templates provided by Stripe-Sigma and see that when looking at subscription invoices and invoice line items they are applying the following filter `(invoice_line_items.source_type = 'subscription' or invoice_line_items.subscription is not null)`. I see the the package uses just the `invoice_line_item.subscription_id is not null` in the `stripe__subscription_line_items` model...

When looking at my data I am seeing some inconsistencies in whether there is a `subscription_id` at the `invoice` or `invoice_line_item` level as well as the usage of `type`. 

At this point I am not sure what would be the correct value to join, filter on. My current thought is there may be a reason why it is on the invoice (main line) and not on the invoice line item (line item) or vice versa in cases of multiple line items on an invoice having their own relationship with a subscription - granted I am not sure this is even possible through Stripe - I just have seen similar structures within finance systems. Stripe including the type only makes this more confusing though.
